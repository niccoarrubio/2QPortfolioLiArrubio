        <h1>VALORANT</h1>
        <h1>Pro Tips and Tricks for Initiator</h1>

        <h2>1. Being an initiator is all about playing with the team. Please dont lurk. </h2>
        <h2>2. Learn flash lineups. They are incredibly handy if you want to coordinate with your team easily. </h2>
        <h2>3. Mini-map reading is key, especially when playing Sova, Fade, and Breach.</h2>

        <h2>Pros and Cons of Playing Initiator as a Beginner</h2>

                <th>Pros</th>
                <th>Cons</th>
                <th>How to Counter These Cons</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Information Gathering: Initiators have abilities that reveal enemy locations, making it easier for the team to gain map control and avoid surprises.</td>
                <td>High Skill Ceiling: Many initiator abilities require good game knowledge, including map layouts, common angles, and a deep understanding of how your team and the enemy team play. </td>
                <td>Master Game Knowledge: Learn each map's layouts and common chokepoints. Study your own and your opponents' agent abilities to anticipate their moves and know the best places to use your utility. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Entry and Attack Facilitation: They are essential for breaking enemy positions and safely initiating site takes by using flashes, stuns, and recon abilities.</td>
                <td>Reliance on Teammates: An initiator's impact is heavily dependent on their team's ability to follow up. If teammates don't push or take engagements after utility is used, the initiator's efforts can be wasted, and they can be left exposed. </td>
                <td>Be Decisive: Act with confidence. Don't ask your team for permission to use utility. Instead, call out your intended action and execute it decisively so your team can play off of your play. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Strategic Playmaking: Initiators can disrupt enemy setups and force opponents out of hiding spots, which creates advantageous angles for their team. </td>
                <td>Risk of Exposure: Using utility to gather intel or clear angles can make the initiator predictable or vulnerable if they don't have a teammate to trade them out or if they use their utility too early without backup. </td>
                <td>Communicate your intentions clearly and tell your team when you are using your abilities. For example, say, "I'm flashing site" and then flash, so your duelist is ready to follow up on the opening you've created.
